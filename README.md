# ScamMap · स्कैम मैप

**Check before you trust.** ScamMap is a community scam map for India. People warn each other about scam phone numbers,
UPI IDs, links and SMS senders, and anyone can check one before they pay, click or call back.

- **Reporters stay anonymous.** Only the area (pincode) of a report is saved: never a name, phone number or location.
- **One report never labels a number.** A number is shown as a scam only when several *unrelated* people report it.
- **Fake reports count as one person.** Report-bombing, fake accounts, rotating networks, copy-paste and grudges are
  caught by trust rules that count people, not reports.
- **Licensed.** Every request checks a signed licence; the server locks when it expires (or when its clock is set back)
  and unlocks without a restart when renewed.

Built by **Team Pi Naut Square** for the *Community Scam Map* brief.

## Features

### The core (what the brief asks for)

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Report** | Paste a number, UPI ID, link or SMS sender (or the whole message), pick what happened, pick the area, send. About 15 seconds, no login. |
| **Check** | A verdict in well under half a second: **Known scam**, **Suspicious**, **No reports** or **Verified business**, with the evidence (time, channel, type, area only). |
| **Map** | The last 7 days of reports, grouped by area. Each circle sits at the area's centre, never at anyone's location. Only trusted reports count. |
| **Alerts** | Only when something is unusual: **SPIKE** (5+ reports in 24 h and twice the area's usual rate) or **NEW_TYPE** (a kind of scam the area hasn't seen in 30 days). |
| **Disputes** | A business can say "this is my number"; it goes under review and can never become Known scam. |
| **Licence** | Ed25519-signed licence checked on every request: `403 LICENSE_EXPIRED` when it lapses, renewed live with no restart. |

### Trust and safety

- **Trust engine:** reports are grouped into independent people (same device, same network, copy-paste notes, bursts,
  grudges); fakes are set aside, never deleted, so real victims still count later.
- **"See how the reports were counted":** an animated view of how every report became a person (or was set aside).
- **Anti-spoofing (rule B2):** one machine cycling fake network blocks within minutes counts as one person.
- **Clock guard:** the latest time the server has seen is saved every 2 s; set the clock back and the API locks.
- **Verified list:** banks' real numbers and helplines are always shown as Verified business.

### Smart checks

- **Whole messages and emails:** a 0-100 risk score from 25+ offline rules (English, Hindi, Hinglish), every number and
  link inside looked up, the closest labelled examples from public datasets, and an optional **Gemini** reading.
- **Second opinion on one identifier:** rule checks + community database + Gemini (which never sees the number itself).
- **Visit the link safely:** the server opens a link in a sandbox and reports what the page asks for (password, OTP,
  card, Aadhaar…), correlated with the static warning signs.
- **Amazon impersonation:** fake order robo-calls, delivery OTP and cash-on-delivery tricks, and US (+1) "support" numbers.
- **Outside lists** (partner block-lists, Reddit-reported Amazon numbers, advisory feeds) show as *Also listed by* and
  **never** change the community verdict.

### Live and maps

- **Live screen:** every new report reaches open screens within a second (area, type, channel and time only), with
  attacks the trust rules blocked, areas heading towards an alert, and a 24-hour forecast.
- **Global threat layer:** malicious URLs reported worldwide to **URLhaus (abuse.ch)**, fetched by the server every
  5 minutes and placed by country; new ones flash red. Kept apart from the community map.
- **Five open map styles** on OpenStreetMap data (Streets, Light, Dark, Humanitarian, Terrain).

### Built for India

- **9 languages** with read-aloud: English, हिंदी, বাংলা, मराठी, தமிழ், తెలుగు, ಕನ್ನಡ, ગુજરાતી, മലയാളം.
- **Local AI** (Llama 3.2 3B via Ollama, on the same machine) reads Hindi and Hinglish notes and fills in a blank scam
  type. Notes never leave the computer and are never stored.
- **Installable app (PWA)** that works offline: reports made without signal are sent later. Ready to package for Android.
- **Report from a screenshot** (text read on the phone), **Telegram bot**, **push alerts** for your area.
- **Lost money help:** the first-hour plan (call 1930), a ready complaint text and a letter to the bank.

### For banks, police and fraud teams

- **Scam campaigns:** numbers, UPI IDs, links and senders used together, with the kill chain and how it spread.
- **Partner console:** banks, telecoms and police get their own filtered view, API key and signed webhooks.
- **Integrations without code:** Telegram, Slack, email and signed bank webhooks; block-lists in; one YAML file.
- **Insights:** analytics on trusted vs set-aside reports, with a written weekly briefing.
- **Transparency log:** every public verdict change in a tamper-evident hash chain; a live "What we store" page.

## Quick start on your machine

Works on Windows, macOS and Linux. On Windows, use **Git Bash** (in VS Code: Terminal → New Terminal → ˅ → Git Bash).

### 1. Install once

| Tool | Version | Get it |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22 LTS (20.19+ works) | https://nodejs.org |
| PostgreSQL | 14 or newer (16/17 recommended) | https://www.postgresql.org/download/ (or use Docker, below) |
| Git | any | https://git-scm.com (Windows: Git for Windows gives you Git Bash) |

Remember the password you set for the `postgres` user and keep port 5432.

### 2. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scammap.git
cd scammap
node -v          # v22.x (or v20.19+)
```

### 3. Create the database

**Option A: PostgreSQL installed on your machine**

```bash
# Windows (Git Bash): make psql available first (change 17 to your version)
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/PostgreSQL/17/bin"
psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "CREATE DATABASE scammap;"
# If psql hangs waiting for the password in Git Bash, put "winpty " in front of the same command

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install postgresql@16 && brew services start postgresql@16
createdb scammap
# then in .env: DATABASE_URL=postgres://<your-mac-user>@localhost:5432/scammap

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';" -c "CREATE DATABASE scammap;"
```

**Option B: Docker** (any OS, nothing else to install)

```bash
docker compose up -d db      # Postgres 16: user postgres, password postgres, database scammap
```

### 4. Settings

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set:

```bash
# Your Postgres password (with Docker keep the default postgres:postgres)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/scammap
# Any long random string. Make one with:
#   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
PEPPER=paste-the-random-string-here
# Optional: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

If your database password contains `@ : / # %`, URL-encode it (`@` → `%40`, `#` → `%23`, `:` → `%3A`, `/` → `%2F`,
`%` → `%25`). Everything else in `.env` is optional; see [Configuration](#configuration-env).

### 5. Install, make your licence keys, build, start

```bash
npm install
npm run gen-keys       # your own key pair: keys/private.pem (never commit) + src/licence/publicKey.ts
npm run build
npm start              # http://localhost:8080 ; tables are created automatically on first start
```

The server starts **locked**: with no licence yet, every API call answers `403 LICENSE_EXPIRED`. That's by design.

### 6. Unlock it and add demo data

Open a **second terminal** in the same folder:

```bash
npm run sign-licence -- --licensee "Demo Bank" --days 30 --upload http://localhost:8080
npm run seed-demo -- --reset    # optional: ~1,000 synthetic reports for the map, alerts and insights
```

### 7. Open the app

- Desktop: **http://localhost:8080**. Try the numbers `seed-demo` prints (a digital-arrest wave in HSR Layout, a bombed
  bakery, a 22-account attack, grudge reports, a fake Amazon order desk…).
- Phone on the same Wi-Fi: `http://<your-computer-IP>:8080` (Windows: `ipconfig`; macOS/Linux: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
  or `hostname -I`). Allow Node through the firewall when asked.

### Day-to-day development

```bash
npm run dev            # terminal 1: server with auto-reload on :8080
npm run dev:client     # terminal 2: app with hot reload on http://localhost:5173 (API proxied to :8080)
npm run check-all      # typecheck + 120 tests + build, before every commit
```

**Quick look without a licence (local only):** set `LICENSE_ENFORCE=false` in `.env`. Never deploy with it.

**Everything in Docker:** `docker compose up --build` runs Postgres and the app on http://localhost:8080. Then unlock
it with the `sign-licence ... --upload http://localhost:8080` command above (Node is needed on the host for that).

---

## Optional add-ons

The app works without any of these. Each one switches on by itself when its settings are in `.env` (restart after
editing `.env`).

| Add-on | What you get | Set up |
|---|---|---|
| **Datasets** | message model, "similar messages", card-fraud replay on the Live screen | [below](#datasets) |
| **Gemini** | AI reading of messages and identifiers, weekly briefing | `GEMINI_API_KEY` from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| **Local AI (Ollama)** | Hindi/Hinglish notes read and classified on your machine | [below](#local-ai-ollama) |
| **Global threat layer** | URLhaus malicious URLs on the map | [below](#global-threat-layer-urlhaus) |
| **Integrations** | Telegram, Slack, email, bank webhooks, block-lists | [Integrations setup](#integrations-setup) |
| **Telegram bot** | check, report and area alerts from Telegram | [below](#telegram-bot) |
| **Push alerts** | phone notifications for your area | works on HTTPS or `localhost`; keys are generated for you |
| **MapTiler** | MapTiler Dark on the Live map | `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY`, then `npm run build` |
| **Android app** | Play Store package | [below](#android-app) |

### Datasets

The Financial Scams Detection CSV ships in `data/`. Download `creditcard.csv` (Kaggle, `mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud`,
150 MB), put it next to it, and import (15-60 s):

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/creditcard.csv data/
npm run import-data          # imports every CSV in data/, trains both models, prints their accuracy
```

Any labelled SMS/email CSV (a label column such as `label`/`category`/`v1` with scam/spam/ham/1/0, and a text column
such as `message`/`text`/`v2`) can be dropped into `data/` the same way. `creditcard.csv` is git-ignored (GitHub rejects
files over 100 MB); to fill a hosted database, run `DATABASE_URL="<external url>" npm run import-data` from your laptop.

### Local AI (Ollama)

1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download (Windows: OllamaSetup.exe, no admin needed). It listens on
   `http://localhost:11434`.
2. `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` (about 2 GB, once). Low on RAM? `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` and set `OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:1b`.
3. Check: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags` lists the model.
4. Restart ScamMap. The log says `local AI ready: llama3.2:3b at http://127.0.0.1:11434`. Try it: Help → Safety checks
   → *Try a note*, or `npm run demo -- hindi`.

Without Ollama (for example on Render) keyword rules still pick a scam type for blank reports.

### Global threat layer (URLhaus)

1. Sign in at https://auth.abuse.ch/ (X, LinkedIn, Google or GitHub), connect a second sign-in provider, **Save
   profile**, then generate an **Auth-Key** in the *Optional* section.
2. `.env`: `URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY=<your key>`.
3. Check: `npm run threats` (one request; prints how many URLs came back and the top countries).
4. Restart, then in the app: **Map** → switch on **Global threats**.

### Telegram bot

1. Telegram → **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → copy the token into `.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, restart.
2. Message your bot: forward a suspicious SMS for a verdict, `/check 9876543210`, `/report`, `/alerts` (or
   `/alerts 560102`), `/stop`, `/lang` (English ↔ हिंदी), `/chatid`. Long polling: no public URL needed.

### Android app

1. Deploy on HTTPS. 2. https://www.pwabuilder.com → enter the URL → **Package for stores → Android** → download.
3. Copy `assetlinks.json` from the package to `client/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`, `npm run build`, redeploy.
The manifest already has an id, categories, shortcuts (Report, Check, Lost money) and store screenshots.

## Try it: a 10-minute demo

With the server running, unlocked and seeded (steps 5-6 above). The full narrated runbook is in [DEMO.md](DEMO.md).

| Step | Do this | You should see |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Report | App → **Report a scam** → paste `Call from +91 93456 12780 said my parcel has drugs, digital arrest` → pick type and area → **Send report** | Sent in about 15 s. Help → *What we store* shows only the pincode was saved |
| 2. One report never labels | Check `+91 93456 12780` | **No reports** (it stays private until someone unrelated reports it) |
| 3. Four verdicts | Check `+91 98823 19275`, `task.pay24@ybl`, `+91 80 4100 2233` | Known scam · Suspicious (masked) · Verified business (a bombed bakery stays green) |
| 4. Fakes stopped | Check `+91 89374 02165` → **See how the reports were counted** | 22 accounts on one Wi-Fi become one grey bubble, 0 counted |
| 5. Anti-spoofing | `npm run demo -- spoof` | 10 accounts rotating networks → 1 person; 3 real people elsewhere → Known scam |
| 6. Map and alerts | **Map**, then **Alerts** | Circles per area; SPIKE + NEW_TYPE in HSR Layout, NEW_TYPE in Whitefield |
| 7. Live | `npm run live-demo -- --fast`, open **Live** | Reports ping, attacks get blocked, Hindi notes are read by the local AI |
| 8. Messages | Check → example **Fake Amazon order** | "Very likely a scam", with plain reasons and the number flagged on an outside list |
| 9. Licence | `npm run sign-licence -- --licensee Demo --minutes 2 --upload http://localhost:8080`, wait 2 min | Lock screen, every call 403; sign a 30-day licence and it unlocks within 10 s, data intact |
| 10. Clock | `DEMO_TIME_TRAVEL=true` in `.env`, restart, `npm run demo -- clock` | Clock moved back 1 day → safety lock → clock right → unlocked |

Quick API checks:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health                                              # {"ok":true}
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/lookup?type=phone&value=9876543210"                # 200 NO_REPORTS
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/lookup?type=phone&value=12345"                     # 400 junk
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/map?pincode=560102&days=7&radius_km=2"             # clusters
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/alerts?pincode=560102"                             # alerts
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}s\n" "http://localhost:8080/lookup?type=phone&value=%2B919882319275"   # ~0.01 s
```

---

## How it works

### Screens at a glance

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Check** | Paste a number, UPI ID, link or SMS sender → community verdict in under 0.5 s, then a **second opinion** that combines rule checks, the community database and Gemini. Paste a whole SMS, WhatsApp message or email → risk score from 25+ offline rules, every number/link inside looked up, the closest labelled messages from the imported datasets, and Gemini's reading in English and Hindi. |
| **Report** | Paste → pick what happened → send. About 15 s and 3 taps; the scam type is suggested from the text, the channel and area are pre-filled. |
| **Map** | OpenStreetMap data in five open styles (Streets, Light, Dark, Humanitarian, Terrain). One circle per area (never a person's location), sized by reports, coloured by severity, pulsing on a spike, with **SPIKE / NEW_TYPE labels on the map** and an alert strip above it. "Next 24 h" view shows the forecast. New reports ping live. |
| **Live** | Reports and attacks blocked by the trust rules as they happen (Server-Sent Events), areas heading towards an alert with "alert level in about N h at this pace", expected reports for the next 24 hours, scam types picking up, and a replay of the card-fraud model on 71,202 held-out real transactions. |
| **Alerts** | Only when something is unusual (SPIKE, NEW_TYPE). A calm "all normal" state otherwise. |
| **Insights** | Analytics, plus a **Public datasets** section (message dataset breakdown, typical scam words, card fraud by hour and amount, model accuracy): trusted vs set-aside reports per day, what the trust rules did, scam types, channels, weekday × hour heatmap, how fast people report, money lost, languages, area table with change vs the previous period, most reported numbers, junk rejected. Every chart has a table view. A written briefing on top (Gemini, or rules if no key). Filter by 7/30/90 days, city or area. |
| **Lost money** | The first-hour plan: call 1930 (with a first-hour countdown), note the details, a ready complaint text for cybercrime.gov.in and a letter to the bank (copy or download), a safety checklist. Nothing typed there leaves the phone. |
| **Campaigns** | Numbers, UPI IDs, links and SMS senders reported together are joined into **scam campaigns**, each with its **kill chain** (contact → hook → pressure → payment → cash-out), how it spread area by area, and a short story. A **scam network graph** links identifiers seen together, written alike, or hosted on the same server. |
| **Partners** | Console for banks, telecoms and police (own API key): live reports about their UPI handles, brand, SMS senders or areas, hourly rollups vs everyone's, signed webhooks, and the scale panel (load-test results). |
| **Help** | Helplines (1930, cybercrime.gov.in, Sanchar Saathi, 1909), signs of a real call (1600/1601 series, `.bank.in`, TRAI sender IDs), privacy, trust rules, dispute form, **transparency log**, **what we store (read live from the database)**, **integrations**, licence panel. |

### One report never labels a number (personal-number protection)

Anyone can type anyone's number, including an ex, a neighbour or a business rival. So the public answer climbs a ladder,
and every rung needs **unrelated** people:

| Credible people after the trust rules | Public verdict | What is shown |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `NO_REPORTS` | "No reports yet. That does not mean it is safe." |
| **1** | **`NO_REPORTS`** (`confirmation: "awaiting_confirmation"`) | Nothing about the report: no type, no dates, no evidence, masked number. The reporter is told it stays private until someone else reports it. |
| 2 | `SUSPICIOUS` | masked number (`98XXXXX210`), "Reported by 2 people. Not yet confirmed…" |
| 3+ with trust weight ≥ 2.0 | `KNOWN_SCAM` | full number, evidence, advice |

"Unrelated" means after rules A-I below: the same device, the same network within a day, copy-pasted notes, a burst of
near-identical reports, or 3+ accounts on one network all count as **one** person. On top of that:

- **Grudge notes** ("my ex", "owes me money", "revenge", "मेरा एक्स", "उधार नहीं लौटाया"…) are recognised in English,
  Hinglish and Hindi. A voice made only of such notes is **not credible**: three grudge reports leave the number at
  `NO_REPORTS`. A grudge note never hides real victims of the same number; they still count.
- **Serial accusers** (people who have reported 3+ numbers that nobody else ever reported) weigh 0.6 instead of 0.8.
- **Owners can dispute** from the result card ("This is my business number"); a disputed number is never `KNOWN_SCAM`.
- Verified businesses and helplines are always `VERIFIED_BUSINESS`.
- Brief rule kept: numbers stay masked until **3** different people. `lookup` with `type`+`value` still returns the
  Appendix A fields, so the judges' tool sees the contract it expects.

### Trust rules: how fake reports are stopped

**Count independent people ("voices"), not reports.** For each identifier the latest 200 reports are grouped into voices
with a union-find. Fakes are **quarantined, never deleted**: if real victims show up later, the verdict updates. All
thresholds live in `src/trust/config.ts`; the engine is a pure function in `src/trust/assess.ts`.

| Rule | What it does | Stops |
|---|---|---|
| **A** Same reporter | One `reporter_id` is one person, however many reports. 3+ on one identifier in a day = spam: counted once, never feeds alerts. | One person reporting 6× in an hour |
| **B** Same network | Addresses are reduced to their **/24** (`49.36.12.7` → `49.36.12`). Same /24 on the same identifier within 24 h = one person. 3+ accounts on one /24 = **sybil ring**: one low-trust person (weight ≤ 0.5), never on the map or in alerts. | 22 fake accounts on one Wi-Fi → 1 |
| **B2** Prefix cycling | Same **/16 block**, each report within **5 minutes** of the previous one (sliding window), **3+ different /24s** from **3+ accounts** → one network cluster = **one person** (low trust, never on the map or in alerts). Unrelated people on other networks still count, so a real scam is cross-verified by them. | One machine rotating fake `ip_prefix` values |
| **C** Copy-paste | Notes compared by character 5-gram similarity (Hindi, Hinglish, English). Similar notes from different accounts merge **only with a sign of coordination**: within 6 h of each other, or shared by 5+ accounts. | Friends pasting the same complaint, even edited |
| **D** Coordinated burst | 6+ people within 3 h whose notes have few different texts (distinct ÷ people < 0.3), or < 30% from different networks → one voice, set aside. | 40 friends bombing a bakery |
| **E** Weights | New 0.8, returning 0.9, corroborated up to 1.5, past burst/sybil member 0.5, serial accuser 0.6; empty note ×0.85, screenshot or money lost ×1.1, grudge note ×0.5. A voice is as strong as its **best** member. | New accounts counting as much as proven reporters |
| **F** Protection | Verified list (Appendix C + helplines) is always `VERIFIED_BUSINESS`; disputed numbers are never `KNOWN_SCAM`. | Bombing a real business |
| **G** Junk | Invalid identifier, unknown area, unparseable or future time → `400` (counted on the Insights screen). | `12345`, `test`, "yesterday" |
| **H** Rate limit | 429 when one `reporter_id` sends more than 3 reports on one identifier, or 30 in total, within an hour. Never by `ip_prefix` alone. | Floods |
| **I** Campaign check | 8+ people but fewer than 20% describe anything first-hand → not `KNOWN_SCAM`, off the map and alerts. | Slow empty-note bombing over days |
| **J** Grudges | Voices made only of personal-dispute notes are not credible and never countable. | "Report my ex's number" |

**Map and alerts** use only *countable* reports: one per credible person per identifier, excluding bursts, sybil rings,
spammers, copy-paste groups, campaigns, grudges and reports about verified numbers. SPIKE: last 24 h ≥ 5 and ≥ 2 × the
daily average of the 7 days before. NEW_TYPE: a type not seen in that area in the 30 days before.

**Why wasn't the bakery labelled a scam?** Every lookup returns `explain`, e.g.
`{"raw_reports":40,"independent_voices":1,"credible_voices":0,"flags":["COPY_PASTE_NOTES","COORDINATED_BURST"],"why":"…"}`.

### Licence

- **Ed25519.** `npm run gen-keys` writes the private key to `keys/private.pem` (git-ignored, never leaves your laptop) and
  the public key into `src/licence/publicKey.ts` (committed and deployed).
- A licence is `{"licensee","expires_at","signature"}` (+ `issued_at`). The signature covers the canonical JSON of every
  other field, so editing the date or name breaks it.
- `POST /license` verifies, saves to Postgres and swaps it in memory **immediately, without restart**.
- **Checked on every request.** If not valid, everything except `/health` and `/license` answers
  `403 {"error":"LICENSE_EXPIRED","reason":"EXPIRED|MISSING|CLOCK_ROLLBACK"}`. Data is never deleted. The app shows
  "Licence expired. Contact your provider." in English and Hindi, checks `/license` every 10 s and unlocks itself.
- **Clock set back?** See *Time-travel defence* below: the API locks with `403 {"error":"LICENSE_EXPIRED","reason":"CLOCK_ROLLBACK","code":"CLOCK_ROLLBACK_DETECTED",…}`
  even after a restart, and unlocks by itself when the clock is right. `npm run clock` shows the stored mark.
- **Bootstrap:** with no licence in the database, `LICENSE_JSON` is loaded at startup.

**Live demo:** `npm run sign-licence -- --licensee "Demo Bank" --minutes 5 --upload https://<server>` first; show
everything else; after 5 minutes a check shows the lock screen and `curl …/lookup?type=phone&value=1930` gives 403;
`… --days 30 --upload …` and the app unlocks within 10 s with all data intact. (Also possible in the app: Help → Licence.)

### Safety: time-travel defence, local AI for Hindi notes, anti-spoofing

#### 1. Time-travel defence (clock set back)
- **High-water mark** in `system_metadata` (`key = 'clock.high_water'`): the latest time this server has ever seen. It is
  raised in **one atomic statement** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET value_ms = GREATEST(…)`), never lowered, so
  restarts and several instances share it.
- **Sources:** a local tick every **2 s**; every request; every accepted report's `occurred_at` / `reported_at`; the
  **database server's own clock** (a different machine on Render, so it catches a clock set back even on a fresh
  install); optionally an HTTPS time witness (`CLOCK_WITNESS_URL`).
- **Request times can only confirm the mark, never push it past the server's clock.** Otherwise one request with a
  future date would lock the server for everyone (and the test tool sends future-dated reports expecting `400`).
- **Lock:** if the clock is more than `CLOCK_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` (120) behind the mark, every API call except `/health`
  and `/license` answers
  `403 {"error":"LICENSE_EXPIRED","reason":"CLOCK_ROLLBACK","code":"CLOCK_ROLLBACK_DETECTED","message":…,"high_water_mark":…,"behind_seconds":…}`
  with header `x-scammap-safety-lock: clock-rollback`. The error code stays `LICENSE_EXPIRED` because that is what
  clients and the test tool expect for a lock; the rest says exactly why. The app shows a dedicated safety screen.
- **Unlock:** automatic as soon as the clock is right. Data is never touched. `npm run clock` shows the state;
  `npm run clock -- reset --yes` forgets the mark (only after a clock that was wrongly far in the *future*).

#### 2. Local AI reads Hindi and Hinglish notes (Ollama)
When a report arrives with **`scam_type` blank**:
1. **At once:** keyword rules in English, Hindi and Hinglish (`giraftar`, `bijli`, `naukri`, `खाता बंद`…) pick a type, so
   the reply is never delayed.
2. **In the background:** if the note is in Hindi (Devanagari), Hinglish, or the rules found nothing, the **local model**
   (Ollama, default `llama3.2:3b`) translates it to English and picks one of the 13 scam types with a confidence, using
   Ollama's JSON-schema structured output. If it is sure (≥ 60%) the stored report is re-labelled and the number
   re-assessed; the Live screen shows *"Local AI read a hinglish note in HSR Layout: Video call blackmail"*.
- A type the **reporter chose is never changed.** `reports.scam_type_source` records `reporter`, `rules`, `local_ai` or `default`.
- **Privacy:** the note goes only to Ollama on this computer (`OLLAMA_URL` must be localhost or your private network
  unless `OLLAMA_ALLOW_REMOTE=true`), is held in memory for seconds, and is never stored or logged. Don't set `OLLAMA_DEBUG`.
- **Speed:** the model gets half the CPU cores (`OLLAMA_THREADS`), so lookups stay fast while it reads.
- Without Ollama (for example on Render) everything still works with the keyword rules; Help → Safety checks says why the
  local AI is off. `AUTO_SCAM_TYPE=false` keeps blank types as `other`.
- Try any note: Help → Safety checks → *Try a note*, or `POST /analyze/note {"note":"…"}`.

#### 3. Anti-spoofing (one host cycling fake `ip_prefix` blocks)
Rule **B2** in the trust rules table. Addresses are reduced to /24, and a keyed hash of the /16 block is stored next to the /24 hash (both
cleared after 30 days). One machine rotating `10.20.1`, `10.20.2`, `10.20.3`… within minutes becomes **one person**;
three unrelated people on other networks still make it `KNOWN_SCAM`. `npm run bench-trust` (offline):

| Pattern | Wrong verdicts |
|---|---|
| 12 accounts cycling /24s in one /16 over 15 min | 100% fooled the engine before → **0-1%** now |
| 8 accounts cycling over 30 min (gaps > 5 min) | 100% before → ~35% (`SUBNET_WINDOW_MINUTES=10`: ~3%) |
| 3 real people on big carrier blocks within 1 h | ~20% before and after (shared stock sentences, rule C), so B2 adds no false merges |
| 15-person real wave on carrier blocks | 0% |

#### Demo the three, narrated, in a terminal
```bash
npm run demo -- spoof     # 10 accounts on rotating prefixes -> 1 person; then 3 real people -> KNOWN_SCAM
npm run demo -- hindi     # blank types + Hindi/Hinglish notes -> rules at once, local AI translation and fix
npm run demo -- clock     # needs DEMO_TIME_TRAVEL=true: moves the server clock back 1 day -> 403 safety lock -> back
npm run demo -- watch     # or change the real Windows clock and watch the lock appear and disappear
npm run live-demo -- --fast   # continuous incoming reports, incl. blank-type Hindi notes and cycling attacks
```

### Map layers: A (community reports) and B (global threat feed)

- **Layer A, core:** the community clusters come from the strict Appendix A `GET /map`, unchanged. This is what the
  judges' tool tests.
- **Layer B, the global view:** switch on **Global threats** on the Map or Live screen. The map zooms out to the world
  and draws malicious URLs reported to **URLhaus (abuse.ch)** as small glowing rings; new ones flash as they arrive and a
  ticker lists them on the Live map. Click a ring for details (defanged URL, malware tag, still online or not, country,
  how it was placed, link to the URLhaus page).
- **How it works:** the server (not the browser) calls `GET https://urlhaus-api.abuse.ch/v1/urls/recent/limit/200/` with
  your `Auth-Key` every 5 minutes, the most abuse.ch allows, so the key never reaches the browser and there are no CORS
  problems. The app polls `GET /threats/global` (licence-gated) every minute and reveals new URLs one by one.
- **Where each URL goes (approximate):** an IP address → the country its address block is registered to (RDAP via
  rdap.org, cached a week); a country domain ending (`.ru`, `.in`, `.br`, `.co.uk`) → that country; a generic or
  vanity ending (`.com`, `.xyz`, `.io`, `.tk`) → the address its domain resolves to (a DNS lookup only), then as for an
  IP. Markers sit on a ring around the country's centre. Up to 100 registry lookups per fetch.
- **Safety:** the malicious URLs are **never opened**. They are shown defanged (`hxxp://1[.]2[.]3[.]4/…`) and never as
  links. URLhaus lists mostly **malware download** URLs (botnet payloads, droppers), so the app calls them "malicious
  URLs", not phishing pages. It is public threat data with no personal data; it never mixes with community reports.

Set-up: [Global threat layer (URLhaus)](#global-threat-layer-urlhaus).

### Message, email and link checks (offline rules + Gemini)

`shared/risk.ts` runs in the browser **and** on the server, so a result appears instantly and offline:

- **Messages:** asks for OTP/PIN/CVV, remote-access apps (AnyDesk, TeamViewer…), `.apk` links, police/CBI/customs/court
  claims, "don't tell anyone", block/arrest threats, urgency, money asks, prizes, task jobs, investment groups, KYC,
  "scan QR to receive", electricity cut-off, upfront fees, courier holds, generic greetings; English, Hindi and Hinglish.
- **Emails:** Reply-To on another domain, a brand name sent from a non-brand domain, free-mail senders claiming to be a
  company, HTML/ZIP/APK attachments, "verify your account" phishing.
- **Links:** brand look-alikes (`sbi-kyc-update.top`, `amaz0n`, digit-for-letter swaps, typosquats), banks not on
  `.bank.in` (RBI mandate, Oct 2025), government not on `.gov.in`, punycode, raw IPs, shorteners, risky TLDs, many
  hyphens/subdomains/digits, bait words, no HTTPS, `user@host` tricks.
- **Phones and senders:** personal mobiles claiming to be a bank (banks use the **1600/1601** series; telemarketing
  **140**), TRAI sender IDs with `-P/-S/-T/-G` suffixes.
- **Reassurances** lower the score: "never share your OTP", official domains, verified senders.

**Gemini** (`src/ai/`) is optional and only *adds* a reading. Before anything leaves the server, phone numbers, UPI IDs,
email names and link query strings are replaced with placeholders, and the text is capped at 6,000 characters. The
reply must match a JSON schema (risk level, score, scam type, summary and red flags in English and Hindi, advice); the
final score is 60% Gemini + 40% rules. Gemini **never** decides a community verdict: Known scam comes only from people.
Prompts and replies are not logged. Errors back off (1 min on 429, 10 min on a bad key) and the rules carry on.

### Amazon impersonation scams

- **Message checks** (Check screen, `POST /analyze`, Telegram bot) recognise the common Amazon patterns: a robo-call or
  SMS about an expensive order or Prime charge with "call / press 1 to cancel"; a "delivery agent" asking for an OTP over
  a call; an unexpected cash-on-delivery parcel; the Amazon name next to an international (+1) or US-style toll-free
  number (888-xxx-xxxx). Each comes with a plain explanation (Amazon never asks you to call a number to cancel; a real
  delivery OTP is only given at your door).
- **US numbers:** many fake "Amazon support" lines are North American. `+1 830-468-0018`, `+1 (818) 322-4089` and
  `001 877 550 9899` are now valid identifiers (`+18304680018`). A bare `830-468-0018` is still read as an Indian
  number, never guessed; the Check screen offers "Written like a US number? Check +1 830-468-0018 instead".
- **Outside list:** `data/external/reddit-amazon-scam-numbers.csv` holds 17 numbers that Reddit users (r/ScamNumbers,
  r/Scams) reported as fake Amazon support, entered by hand with no usernames. It is loaded through
  `config/connectors.yaml`, so a lookup shows **"Also listed by: Reddit r/ScamNumbers (unverified)"** and the message
  risk goes up, but it **never counts as a report** and never changes the community verdict (one outside claim must not
  label a number). `+1 206-922-0880` is widely listed as Amazon's real international line and is also faked as caller
  ID by scammers, so it carries that warning instead of a scam label. Add more rows (`type,value,label`) and save: the
  server reloads the list within seconds.
- **Demo data:** `seed-demo` adds two synthetic Indian numbers: a fake Amazon order desk (4 people, Known scam) and a
  fake delivery-OTP caller (3 people).

### Datasets, models, live feed and forecast

| Dataset (in PostgreSQL) | Used for | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Financial Scams Detection** (Al Rafi Ahmed, Gazi Faizul Islam, Mendeley Data 2025, doi:10.17632/znsk27yk3h.1): 520 labelled scam/ham messages, English and Bangla | Naive Bayes text model (character 3-4-grams + words, works across scripts) and a TF-IDF index of the closest labelled examples | 5-fold cross-validation on 516 unique messages: **91.9% accuracy, 91.8% precision, 94.8% recall** |
| **Credit Card Fraud Detection** (Worldline and ULB Machine Learning Group, Dal Pozzolo et al.; Kaggle `mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud`): 284,807 anonymised transactions, 492 frauds, Europe, Sept 2013 | Logistic regression (Adam, class-weighted, L2) on V1-V28, log amount and time of day; **time-ordered split**: first 60% train, next 15% tunes the threshold, last 25% test | On the 71,202 latest transactions it never saw: **precision 100%, recall 66%, average precision 79.5%** (62 of 94 frauds caught, 0 false alarms) |

How they are used, and their limits:
- **Message check:** the dataset model counts for 20-25% of the score **only when it recognises at least 40% of the text**
  (it was trained on Bangladeshi messages; a Hindi message gets no say). The closest labelled examples are shown as
  evidence and passed to Gemini as context. Rules and Gemini still carry most of the score.
- **Card replay (Live screen):** a demonstration of real-time fraud scoring on real data. It is European data from 2013,
  is never placed on the India map and never mixed into community reports.
- Datasets are reference data: `POST /admin/reset` keeps them, and they never appear as reports, on the map or in alerts.

**Second opinion on a number, UPI ID, link or sender** (`POST /analyze/identifier`): the community verdict comes first
and bounds the score (Known scam ≥ 85, verified ≤ 8, Suspicious ≥ 45). Rule checks (number series, look-alike domains,
bank names on personal UPI IDs, risky handles…) can be softened by Gemini but not erased. **Gemini never receives a
phone number or UPI ID**: only a description ("Indian personal mobile number", "PhonePe UPI ID whose name contains a bank
name"), the rule findings and the public community verdict. Results are cached for an hour.

**Live feed:** every new report (area, scam type, channel), every attack the trust rules catch (coordinated burst,
many accounts on one network, copy-paste, repeat reporter, grudge, reports against a verified business, rate limit), and
every new SPIKE/NEW_TYPE alert, pushed over Server-Sent Events. One attack is shown at most once every 3 minutes. Alerts are
checked 3 s after an area's last report, so a bulk load never announces an alert that vanishes a second later.

**Forecast:** Holt linear smoothing on 8 daily counts of trusted reports, blended 60/40 with the last 6 hours' pace. "Alert
level" is exactly the SPIKE rule (5+ and 2× the 7-day average); "at this pace" is shown only after 2+ reports in 6 hours.
Fake reports never feed it.

**Map styles:** OpenStreetMap Standard, CARTO Positron (Light) and Dark Matter, OSM Humanitarian (OSM France) and
OpenTopoMap, all OpenStreetMap data with each provider's attribution. None of them needs a key. Public tile servers are for
light use; for real traffic set `VITE_TILE_URL` or use a tile provider.

**Optional MapTiler key (Live map):** get a free key at https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/ (the free plan is for
non-commercial use and pauses when its monthly quota is used up), add `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY=...` to `.env`, then
`npm run build` and restart. The Live map switches to MapTiler's dark data-visualisation style, and both maps get a
"MapTiler Dark" and "MapTiler Streets" option in the layers menu. The key is built into the page (every browser map key is),
so in MapTiler Cloud limit it to your addresses (`http://localhost:8080` and your `https://…onrender.com`). On Render,
add `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY` as an environment variable; the Dockerfile passes it to the build. If the key is wrong or out of
quota, the map falls back to CARTO Dark Matter by itself.

### More features in detail

#### See-through trust engine
On any number with 2+ reports, **See how the reports were counted** animates every report (a dot on a 24-hour timeline)
into the "people" it belongs to. Bursts, one network, copy-paste groups, repeat reporters and grudges end up in grey,
dashed bubbles with the reason underneath. Try the bombed bakery or the sybil number from `seed-demo`.

#### Live link check (static + runtime, correlated)
**Visit the link safely** follows redirects (max 5, ports 80/443 only, 1 MB, 8 s), reads the final page without running
it, and reports what the page actually does: asks for a password, OTP, card, CVV, PIN, Aadhaar, PAN or account number;
uses a bank's name on a foreign domain; posts the form to another site; offers an `.apk`; opens UPI or chat apps. Domain
age and network come from RDAP (no WHOIS personal data). Each static warning sign that the visit **confirms** is shown as
a correlation (for example "look-alike name" + "page collects bank details" = **Proven phishing**).

#### Scam campaigns, kill chain and network
Identifiers pasted in one message (the app sends the other numbers, UPI IDs and links from the same message as
`related_identifiers`) and links on the same server are joined into campaigns. Each campaign shows its kill chain, the
order it reached each area, and a short story (Gemini when set, rules otherwise; no identifiers are sent). Similar wording
is drawn in the network graph but never merges campaigns on its own.

#### Partner console, rollups and load test
```bash
npm run partner -- demo             # prints two API keys: paste one into the app's Partners screen
npm run seed-demo -- --reset        # run after creating partners, so their matches fill up
npm run load-test -- --seconds 20 --concurrency 50
```
Partners watch UPI handles (`@oksbi`), brand words inside UPI IDs and links (`sbi`, `yono`), SMS senders, number prefixes,
their own domains (look-alikes are matched) and areas. Matches arrive in the console and, with `--webhook`, as POSTs
signed with `x-scammap-signature: sha256=<HMAC of the body>`. Dashboards read **hourly rollups** that are refreshed
incrementally (only the hours touched by new reports), so they stay fast at any size.

#### Integrations without code
`config/connectors.yaml` sends alerts, caught attacks and reports to Telegram, Slack, any webhook or email, and reads
block-lists (CSV file or JSON URL) that show as **Also listed by**. Save the file and the server reloads it within
seconds; each connector turns on when its `.env` values are set (restart after editing `.env`). Status and a
**Send test** button per output: Help → Integrations. Step by step: [Integrations setup](#integrations-setup).

#### Push alerts on the phone
Alerts → **Turn on alerts for <area>**. Needs HTTPS (or `localhost`): on a phone, use the deployed URL. VAPID keys
are generated once and kept in the database (or set `VAPID_*`). Only alerts are pushed, never single reports.

#### Lost money: the first hour
Help → Lost money (or the button on a scam verdict): call 1930, a first-hour countdown, the details form, a ready
complaint text for cybercrime.gov.in and a letter to the bank in English or Hindi, and a checklist. Nothing is sent.

#### Languages and read aloud
English and Hindi are complete. Bangla, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati and Malayalam cover the main screens and
scam types and fall back to English elsewhere; fill the rest with `npm run translate` (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`), then
`npm run build`. **Read aloud** uses the phone's own voice for the chosen language.

#### Screenshot to report, and offline reports
**From a screenshot** reads the text on the phone (Tesseract.js, English + Hindi, files served from `/ocr`), then finds the
number, UPI ID and link like a paste. With no signal, a report is saved on the phone and sent automatically when the
connection returns (idempotent `report_id`, so it never counts twice).

## Privacy

These rules come from the brief (breaking any of them disqualifies a team), so they are built into the database design, not added on top.

- **No identity stored:** no login; `reporter_id` and `ip_prefix` are stored only as HMAC-SHA256 with a secret pepper.
  Network hashes are cleared after 30 days.
- **No location stored:** only the area. The map draws the official area point. "Use my location" picks the nearest area
  **on the phone**; coordinates are never sent.
- **No note text stored:** only its length, a keyed hash, keyed shingle hashes, its script (Devanagari/Latin/mixed) and a
  grudge yes/no. Money lost is kept only as a band (none, under ₹10k, ₹10k-1 lakh, over ₹1 lakh).
- **Masked until 3 people;** a single report shows nothing at all.
- **Wording:** "Reported by 7 people", never "scammer" or "fraud".
- **Evidence** has only time, channel, scam type and area. A challenge's `contact_email` is never returned.
- **Logs:** method, route pattern, status, duration. No URLs, bodies, IPs or Gemini prompts.
- **Live feed and forecast** carry the area, scam type and channel only; never a number, ID, link, reporter or network.
- **Second opinion:** phone numbers and UPI IDs never go to Gemini, only a description of them.
- **Map k-anonymity:** the app's map hides areas with fewer than 3 reports (no count, no scam type), so one report can't be
  pinned to a place. The "how reports were counted" view shows times in whole hours and only when 2+ reports exist.
- **Transparency log:** every public verdict change is appended to a hash chain (identifier as a keyed hash); editing or
  deleting any entry breaks every later hash, and the app re-verifies the chain on each read. Help → *What we store*
  lists every table and column, read live from the database.
- **Local AI notes:** a note goes only to Ollama on the same computer (or your private network), is kept in memory until
  it is read, and is never stored or logged; only the resulting scam type and its source are saved.
- **Network blocks:** only keyed hashes of the /24 and /16 are stored, and both are cleared after 30 days.
- **Screenshots** are read on the phone (Tesseract.js, served by our own server); the image is never uploaded.
- **Lost money** details stay on the phone (session storage). **Push** keeps only the browser's push address and the area;
  **Telegram** stores a chat id only for people who send /alerts (deleted with /stop); bot reports use a keyed hash.
- **Partners** see identifiers masked until 3 unrelated people confirm them, like everyone else; their API keys are stored
  only as SHA-256. Webhooks carry area and scam type, never a reporter.
- **Link check** never sends cookies, never runs scripts, never submits forms, strips query strings (they can carry a
  victim's details), and refuses private addresses (SSRF guard: DNS checked, connection pinned to the checked address).
- **No scraping** and no lookups of anyone's data elsewhere. Gemini receives redacted message text only, and only when
  a user asks for a message check.

| `POST /demo/time-travel` `{"seconds_back"}` | **only with `DEMO_TIME_TRAVEL=true`**, not gated: move the server clock back (0 = right again) |

Normalisation (one shared function, `shared/normalize.ts`): phones → `+91` + 10 digits (also `0…`, `91…`, `0091…`,
hyphens, spaces, Devanagari digits, a `+` decoded as a space); toll-free `1800/1860…` and helplines (`1930`, `112`…)
keep their digits; all-same digits and `12345` are junk. UPI → lower case, `upi://pay?pa=` QR links unwrapped. Links →
`https://`, no `www.`, no query/fragment/trailing slash, defanged `hxxp`/`[.]` repaired, look-alike Unicode domains turned
into punycode. SMS senders → the 6-character code without the operator prefix (`AD-`) or the TRAI suffix (`-S`, `-T`, `-P`, `-G`).

## Integrations setup

Seven connectors, one place: `config/connectors.yaml` says **what** goes **where**, `.env` holds the secrets.

| Connector | Kind | Sends / reads | Needs in `.env` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `area-alerts-telegram` | output | SPIKE / NEW_TYPE alerts | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID` |
| `fraud-team-slack` | output | alerts + attacks the trust rules blocked | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| `bank-fraud-desk` | output | every new report + alerts, **Bengaluru and Mumbai only**, HMAC-signed | `BANK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `BANK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `alerts-by-email` | output | alerts | `SMTP_URL`, `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM`, `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` |
| `partner-blocklist` | input | `data/external/blocklist.csv` | nothing (on) |
| `reddit-amazon-numbers` | input | `data/external/reddit-amazon-scam-numbers.csv` | nothing (on) |
| `advisory-feed` | input | a JSON list from a URL, re-read every 30 min | `ADVISORY_FEED_URL` |

What leaves the server: the **area** (pincode, locality, city), the scam type, the channel and counts. Never a
reporter, a note, or a reported number. Inputs only ever show as "Also listed by"; they never count as reports.

**The loop for each one:** put the values in `.env` → restart the server (Ctrl+C, `npm run dev`) →
`npm run integrations` (checks the values, logs in where it is safe, sends nothing) → **Send test** in Help →
Integrations, or `npm run integrations -- test all`.

### Telegram: area alerts to a group, channel or your own chat
1. Telegram → **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → pick a name and a username ending in `bot` → copy the token.
2. `.env`: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AA...` → restart the server (this also starts the ScamMap bot).
3. Choose where alerts go and get its id from the bot:
   - **your own chat**: open your bot, press Start, send `/chatid` → a positive number;
   - **a group**: add the bot to the group, send `/chatid@YourBotName` there (with privacy mode on, bots in groups
     only see commands addressed to them) → a negative number;
   - **a channel**: add the bot as an admin that can post, post `/chatid` in the channel → `-100...`
     (public channels can also use `@channelname`).
4. `.env`: `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890` → restart → **Send test**.

One bot token can run on one server at a time (Telegram allows one long-poll per token); a second copy logs
"Conflict". `/chatid` stores nothing.

### Slack: alerts and blocked attacks in a channel
1. [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From scratch** → name `ScamMap`, pick
   your workspace.
2. **Incoming Webhooks** → switch **Activate Incoming Webhooks** on → **Add New Webhook** (to Workspace) → pick a
   channel (e.g. `#fraud-alerts`) → **Allow**.
3. Copy the URL (`https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../...`). Treat it like a password.
4. `.env`: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...` → restart → **Send test**.

Errors show Slack's own words in the status line: `no_service` (webhook deleted), `channel_not_found`,
`invalid_token`.

### Bank fraud desk: signed webhook
A partner's endpoint gets `POST {event, text, data}` with headers `x-scammap-event` and
`x-scammap-signature: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body, keyed with the shared secret>`. Failed deliveries are
retried (now, +2 s, +8 s); 4xx answers are not retried.

1. Make a secret: `npm run integrations -- secret` → paste the line into `.env`.
2. Pick a receiver:
   - **local (recommended for the demo):** in a second terminal `npm run webhook-receiver`. It checks every
     signature the way a bank should (`verifySignature` in `src/lib/deliver.ts`) and prints each event.
     `.env`: `BANK_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:9900/scammap`. Add `-- --fail` to show the retries.
   - **online:** open [webhook.site](https://webhook.site), copy "Your unique URL" into `BANK_WEBHOOK_URL`
     (it shows the body and headers; it cannot check the signature for you).
3. Restart → **Send test**. Real traffic: only Bengaluru and Mumbai events (the `filter: cities` in the YAML).

### Email (Gmail SMTP)
1. Google account → **Security** → turn on **2-Step Verification** (app passwords need it).
2. [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) → name it `ScamMap` → copy the
   16-letter password and **remove the spaces**.
3. `.env` (an `@` in the user name is written `%40`):
   ```
   SMTP_URL=smtps://you%40gmail.com:abcdefghijklmnop@smtp.gmail.com:465
   ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=ScamMap Alerts <you@gmail.com>
   ALERT_EMAIL_TO=you@gmail.com,teammate@example.com
   ```
4. Restart → `npm run integrations` (logs in, sends nothing) → **Send test** (subject starts with `[TEST]`).

Port 465 blocked on campus Wi-Fi? Use `smtp://you%40gmail.com:...@smtp.gmail.com:587`, or a phone hotspot. Any other
SMTP works the same way (Outlook `smtp://...@smtp-mail.outlook.com:587`, a Mailtrap sandbox for a fake inbox).

### Advisory feed: a JSON list from a URL
The feed is `[{ "type": "phone|upi|url|sender_id", "value": "...", "label": "..." }]` (or `{ "items": [...] }`).
A sample is in `data/external/advisory-sample.json` (made-up demo identifiers, labelled as such).

- **local:** `npm run integrations -- serve-advisory` in another terminal →
  `ADVISORY_FEED_URL=http://localhost:9901/advisory.json`.
- **online:** [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) → paste the sample as `advisory.json` → **Create secret
  gist** → **Raw** → copy that URL (drop the long commit id after `/raw/` to always get the latest version).

Restart; the panel shows `advisory-feed  on: 7 listed`. Check `VM-SBIUPD` or `amzrefund.demo@ybl` in the app:
**Also listed by: Sample advisory ...**; the second still says **No reports** (outside lists never count as
reports). The feed is re-read every 30 minutes, or right away when `config/connectors.yaml` is saved.

### See real events flow
With the server running: `npm run live-demo -- --fast` (or `npm run seed-demo -- --reset`). Blocked attacks reach
Slack within seconds, area alerts reach Telegram, Slack and email, Bengaluru/Mumbai reports reach the bank receiver.
Each output sends at most 30 events a minute (the rest are counted as "dropped").

| Problem in the status line | Fix |
|---|---|
| `off: set X in .env, then restart the server` | the value is empty or the server was not restarted |
| `HTTP 401` (Telegram) | token wrong or revoked: `/token` in @BotFather, paste again |
| `HTTP 400: ... chat not found` (Telegram) | wrong `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID`, or the bot is not in that group/channel |
| `HTTP 403: ... bot is not a member` / `not enough rights` | add the bot to the group; in a channel make it an admin that can post |
| `HTTP 400: ... group chat was upgraded to a supergroup` | the group got a new id: send `/chatid@YourBotName` again and update `.env` |
| `HTTP 404: no_service` (Slack) | the webhook was removed: add a new one |
| `fetch failed (ECONNREFUSED)` (bank) | the receiver is not running, or the port differs |
| `HTTP 401: bad signature` (bank) | `BANK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` differs between the server and the receiver |
| `Invalid login: 535` (email) | use an app password, not the Gmail password; no spaces |
| `HTTP 404` / `not JSON` (advisory) | use the Gist's **Raw** URL, not the Gist page |

---

## Configuration (.env)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`; it explains every value. `.env` is read at start-up by `npm start`, `npm run dev` and
the scripts (real environment variables win). Restart after editing it.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `DB_SSL` | TLS to the database. Always on for Supabase, Azure, Neon and Render external URLs (only `disable` turns it off there); `true` for other hosted Postgres |
| `DB_LOCKDOWN` | default on: at every start, row level security on the server's own tables and no grants for Supabase's `anon`/`authenticated` roles, so Supabase's automatic HTTP API can't read them. `false` to skip |
| `PORT` | listen port (Render sets it) |
| `PEPPER` | secret for HMAC of reporter ids, networks and note fingerprints; **required** in production |
| `LICENSE_ENFORCE` | `true` (default). `false` disables the lock: local development only |
| `LICENSE_JSON` | optional bootstrap licence, loaded only if the database has none |
| `TRUST_BODY_IP_PREFIX` | `true` for judging (the test tool sends `ip_prefix`). `false` in a real deployment |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | optional; turns on Gemini for message analysis and the insights briefing |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | default `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`; falls back to `gemini-flash-latest` if the model is not found |
| `VITE_TILE_URL` | build time, optional: another OSM tile server for heavy traffic |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID` | optional: the Telegram bot, and a group that receives every alert |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `BANK_WEBHOOK_URL` + `BANK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SMTP_URL` + `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM/TO`, `ADVISORY_FEED_URL` | optional: switch on the connectors in `config/connectors.yaml` ([setup](#integrations-setup)) |
| `CONNECTORS_FILE` | use another connectors file (default `config/connectors.yaml`) |
| `CONNECTOR_TEST_TOKEN` | production only: required header `x-connector-test-token` for `POST /connectors/test` (the Send test button) |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` | optional: web push keys (generated and stored in the database when empty) |
| `LINKSCAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | keep `false`: the link sandbox refuses private/local addresses |
| `CLOCK_TOLERANCE_SECONDS`, `CLOCK_WITNESS_URL` | time-travel defence: allowed drift (120) and an optional HTTPS time witness |
| `DEMO_TIME_TRAVEL` | demo only (ignored in production): lets `npm run demo -- clock` move the server clock back |
| `LOCAL_AI`, `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_THREADS`, `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `OLLAMA_ALLOW_REMOTE`, `AUTO_SCAM_TYPE` | local AI note reader (default `llama3.2:3b` at `http://127.0.0.1:11434`) |
| `SUBNET_CLUSTERING`, `SUBNET_WINDOW_MINUTES` | anti-spoofing rule B2 (on, 5 minutes) |
| `URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY`, `THREAT_FEED`, `THREAT_FEED_LIMIT`, `THREAT_FEED_MINUTES`, `THREAT_FEED_DNS` | map layer B: free abuse.ch key, on/off, URLs per fetch (200), minutes between fetches (5, minimum), place generic domains by DNS (true) |
| `VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN` | build time, optional: the server's address when the website is served by a proxy such as Vercel; the Live stream then connects to the server directly |
| `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY` | build time, optional: MapTiler key. The Live map then uses MapTiler Dark, and MapTiler Streets is added to the style menu. Falls back to the keyless CARTO style if the key fails |

## Deploy (HTTPS)

### The free way: Supabase (database) + Render (website and API)

One Render web service serves the whole website and the API from one address; Supabase holds the data. Both free
plans need no payment. Total: about 20 minutes.

```
browser / phone  ──►  Render web service (Singapore, Docker)  ──►  Supabase Postgres (Singapore)
                      website + API + live feed + clock guard        reports, licence, datasets
```

**1. Supabase project** (https://supabase.com → sign in with GitHub)
- **New project**: name `scammap`, a database password (use **Generate a password** and save it), region
  **Southeast Asia (Singapore)** (same region as Render keeps each query to a few milliseconds; if you host the server
  on Azure Central India instead, pick **South Asia (Mumbai)**).
- If the form offers it, untick the automatic **Data API** exposure: ScamMap never uses it. (The server also locks its
  tables against it by itself: `DB_LOCKDOWN`, on by default.)
- When the project is ready: **Connect** (top bar) → **Session pooler** → copy the URI. It looks like
  `postgres://postgres.<project-ref>:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-<n>-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`. Copy
  the host exactly as shown (`aws-0` or `aws-1`, and your region): it differs between projects.
  Put your password in place of `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` (URL-encode `@ : / # %` if it has them).
  Use the **Session** pooler: the *Direct* address is IPv6-only on the free plan (Render can't reach it) and the
  *Transaction* pooler (port 6543) drops the session locks ScamMap uses.

**2. Check it from your laptop** (Git Bash, in the project folder):
```bash
npm run db:check -- --url "postgres://postgres.<ref>:<password>@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```
It should say *connected* and *no tables yet*.

**3. Fill it.** Stop your local server first, then pick one:
```bash
LOCAL="postgres://postgres:<local-password>@localhost:5432/scammap"
SB="<session pooler URI>"

# A) Everything from your laptop: reports, licence, partners, datasets and models (no pg_dump needed)
npm run db:copy -- --from "$LOCAL" --to "$SB"

# B) Clean start for judging: only the datasets and their models, no reports
npm run db:copy -- --from "$LOCAL" --to "$SB" --datasets-only

# C) Or build the datasets again from the CSV files instead of copying
DATABASE_URL="$SB" npm run import-data
```
`db:copy` creates ScamMap's tables in the target, copies every table in batches (the 284,807 card rows take a few
minutes over home internet), moves the id counters on and checks that the row counts match. If the target already
has rows (an earlier try), add `--replace`. Your local database is only read.
Run `npm run db:check -- --url "<session pooler URI>"` again: tables, datasets and *closed to Supabase's public HTTP
API* (after the server's first start).

**4. Render** (https://dashboard.render.com → sign in with GitHub)
- Push your code to GitHub first.
- **New → Blueprint** → pick the repo → it reads `render.yaml` (free web service in Singapore, no database).
- When it asks for **DATABASE_URL**, paste the session pooler URI. Leave **LICENSE_JSON** empty. **Apply**.
- The first build takes 5-10 minutes. The log ends with `scammap listening`.

**5. Unlock and check**
```bash
npm run sign-licence -- --licensee "Pi Naut Square" --days 30 --upload https://<your-service>.onrender.com
curl https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health           # {"ok":true}
curl https://<your-service>.onrender.com/license          # "status":"VALID"
curl https://<your-service>.onrender.com/system/network   # your network, not Render's
```
Open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com` on your phone: that's the website. Add it to the home screen.

**6. Keep it awake:** https://uptimerobot.com → *New monitor* → HTTP(s) → `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health`
→ every 5 minutes. A free Render service otherwise sleeps after 15 minutes idle, and the first request after that
takes about a minute. The running server also keeps the Supabase project active (a free Supabase project pauses
after a week with no activity).

Every `git push` redeploys. Optional: a nicer address on Vercel in front: `npm run vercel-config -- https://<your-service>.onrender.com`
([Website on Vercel](#website-on-vercel-server-stays-on-render)).

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Render asks for a card | `render.yaml` must say `plan: free` (it does); Render may still ask once to verify a new account |
| log: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND db.<ref>.supabase.co` | that's the Direct (IPv6) address: use the **Session pooler** URI |
| `tenant/user postgres.<ref> not found` (or `Tenant or user not found`) | the pooler host doesn't match your project's region/cluster (`aws-0-…` vs `aws-1-…`, `ap-south-1` vs `ap-southeast-1`), or the user isn't `postgres.<project-ref>`: copy the whole URI from **Connect → Session pooler** and only replace the password |
| log: `password authentication failed` | wrong password, or it has `@ : / # %` that need URL-encoding; reset it in Supabase → Settings → Database |
| every call answers 403 | no licence yet: step 5 |
| site is slow to answer the first time | the free service was asleep: step 6 |

### Azure: App Service + PostgreSQL, deployed from GitHub

The server runs on **Azure App Service** (Linux, Node 22) and the data on **Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible
server**. A GitHub Actions workflow in this repo (`.github/workflows/azure-app-service.yml`) builds, tests and deploys
on every push to `main`.

**Cost:** with *Azure for Students* ($100 credit, no card) the database's Burstable **B1ms** size is in the 12-month
free amounts (750 hours a month). The App Service **Basic B1** plan (about US$13 a month) comes out of the credit; the
Free F1 plan is limited to 60 CPU minutes a day and can't stay always on, so it won't run ScamMap. Delete the resource
group after the event to stop all charges (stopping the app alone does not stop the plan's charge).

**0. Find your allowed region.** Student subscriptions may deploy only to a few regions. Portal → **Policy** →
**Assignments** → *Allowed resource deployment regions* → **Parameters**. Pick **Central India** if listed, otherwise
the closest one listed, and use the same region for everything below.

**1. Database.** Portal → **Create a resource** → *Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server* → **Create**:
- (Or skip this step and use Supabase: set `DATABASE_URL` in step 3 to the Supabase session pooler URI, region South
  Asia (Mumbai).)
- Resource group: new, `scammap-rg`. Server name: `scammap-db-<yourname>`. Region: as above. Version: 16.
- Workload type: **Development**, then **Configure server**: Burstable, **Standard_B1ms**, 32 GiB storage, high
  availability off.
- Authentication: PostgreSQL only. Admin: `scammapadmin` and a strong password (letters and digits are easiest: other
  characters must be URL-encoded in `DATABASE_URL`).
- Networking: **Public access**. Tick **Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server**, and
  **Add current client IP address** (so your laptop can import the datasets).
- **Review + create** (5-10 minutes). Then the server → **Databases** → **Add** → `scammap`.

**2. Web App.** Portal → **Create a resource** → **Web App**:
- Resource group `scammap-rg`, name `scammap-<yourname>`, Publish **Code**, Runtime stack **Node 22 LTS**,
  OS **Linux**, same region, pricing plan: new, **Basic B1**.
- **Deployment** tab: continuous deployment **Disable** (this repo brings its own workflow), basic authentication
  **Enable**.
- **Review + create**, then open the app and copy its **Default domain**.

**3. Settings.** In the Web App:
- **Settings → Environment variables → App settings**, add, then **Apply**:

  | Name | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://scammapadmin:<password>@scammap-db-<yourname>.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/scammap` |
  | `DB_SSL` | `true` |
  | `PEPPER` | a long random string (`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`) |
  | `LICENSE_ENFORCE` | `true` |
  | `TRUST_BODY_IP_PREFIX` | `true` for judging (`false` for real use) |
  | `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
  | `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` | `false` (the workflow uploads a finished build) |
  | optional | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY`, `LICENSE_JSON`, the [integration values](#integrations-setup) |

- **Settings → Configuration → General settings**: Startup Command `node dist/server/src/server.js`, **Always on: On**,
  **HTTPS Only: On**, **SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials: On**. **Save**.
- Optional: **Monitoring → Health check** → on, path `/health`.

**4. Connect GitHub.**
- Web App **Overview** → **Download publish profile**.
- GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:
  - **Secrets** tab → *New repository secret* `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` = the whole file's contents.
  - **Variables** tab → *New repository variable* `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` = `scammap-<yourname>`.
- **Actions** tab → *Deploy to Azure App Service* → **Run workflow** (or push to `main`). About 5-8 minutes; the last
  step waits for `/health` and prints the live address. If your branch is called `master`, change `branches: [main]`
  in the workflow.

**5. Unlock and check** (from your laptop, with your Default domain):
```bash
npm run sign-licence -- --licensee "Pi Naut Square" --days 30 --upload https://<default-domain>
curl https://<default-domain>/health            # {"ok":true}
curl https://<default-domain>/license           # "status":"VALID"

The website can also go on Vercel in front of Azure: `npm run vercel-config -- https://<default-domain>`
([Website on Vercel](#website-on-vercel-server-stays-on-render)).

### Render (Singapore), free, with the included Blueprint

`render.yaml` creates a **free** web service in Singapore that uses Supabase for data (above). To use Render's own
free Postgres instead (it expires after 30 days), set **Blueprint Path** to `render.render-postgres.yaml` when you
create the Blueprint. Both are free, so no payment is needed (a Blueprint without `plan: free` defaults to the paid
Starter instance and asks for a card).

1. Push the repo to GitHub (check [Before you push](#before-you-push-to-github) first).
2. https://dashboard.render.com → **New → Blueprint** → connect GitHub → pick the repo → **Apply**. It builds the
   Docker image (5-10 minutes); `PEPPER` is generated for you. Leave `LICENSE_JSON` empty for now.
3. Unlock it from your laptop: `npm run sign-licence -- --licensee "Pi Naut Square" --days 30 --upload https://<your-service>.onrender.com`
4. Check `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/license` says `"status":"VALID"`, and `/system/network` shows your network.
5. **Keep it awake:** a free service sleeps after 15 minutes without requests, and the first request after that takes
   about a minute, which fails the half-second lookup test. Add a free monitor at https://uptimerobot.com: *New monitor*
   → HTTP(s) → URL `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health` → interval 5 minutes. One always-awake service fits in
   Render's 750 free hours a month.

What the free tier means for ScamMap:

| Limit | Effect |
|---|---|
| Free Postgres expires **30 days** after creation (14 days' grace to upgrade, then deleted) | fine for the event; export or upgrade before then if you keep it |
| 512 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU | enough for judging traffic (the server uses about 150 MB); slower builds and load tests |
| Render may restart a free service at any time | data is in Postgres; the licence and clock mark survive restarts |
| Outgoing SMTP ports are blocked | the `alerts-by-email` connector can't send; Telegram, Slack and webhooks work |
| Render may still ask for a card to verify a new account | that is their anti-abuse check; without a card, use [Azure](#azure-app-service--postgresql-deployed-from-github) (student credit, no card) |

To make it always on for judging day: the service → **Settings → Instance Type → Starter** (US$7/month); the database →
upgrade before day 30 if you need the data longer. Any other host works too (Railway, Fly.io, a VM): one Docker image
plus `DATABASE_URL`. For Supabase or Neon set `DB_SSL=true`. In a real deployment also set
`TRUST_BODY_IP_PREFIX=false` and protect `/admin/reset`.

### Website on Vercel (server stays on Render)

Vercel hosts the **website** from its CDN and forwards every API path to your server, so the whole app works on one
address (`https://<project>.vercel.app`). The server itself does not run on Vercel: it keeps state in memory and runs
background work (the clock guard tick, the live stream, the threat feed, the Telegram bot), which serverless functions
don't keep running. Deploy the server first (Render, above), then:

1. Write the Vercel config with your server's address, commit and push:
   ```bash
   npm run vercel-config -- https://<your-service>.onrender.com
   git add vercel.json && git commit -m "Vercel config" && git push
   ```
2. https://vercel.com/new → **Import** your GitHub repo. Keep **Framework Preset: Other**; `vercel.json` already sets
   the install command (`npm ci`), the build (`npm run build:client`) and the output (`dist/public`).
3. **Environment Variables** (build time, baked into the page, so never put secrets here):
   `VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN=https://<your-service>.onrender.com` (the Live screen connects to the server directly, so a proxy
   can't buffer the stream), and optionally `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY`, `VITE_TILE_URL`.
4. **Deploy**. Then check:
   ```bash
   curl https://<project>.vercel.app/health            # {"ok":true}  (answered by your server through Vercel)
   curl https://<project>.vercel.app/license           # "status":"VALID"
   curl https://<project>.vercel.app/system/network    # your own network's first three parts, not Vercel's
   ```
   Open the site, check `+91 98823 19275` (after seeding) and open **Live**: the green "Live" dot means the stream is on.

Every push to GitHub redeploys the website; the server redeploys on Render. Server secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `PEPPER`,
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, licence) stay on Render only. Run load tests and the simulator against the Render address (Vercel's
firewall may slow a burst of thousands of requests); give judges whichever address passes `npm run simulate`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `psql: command not found` (Git Bash) | `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/PostgreSQL/17/bin"` (add it to `~/.bashrc` to keep it) |
| `password authentication failed` | the password in `DATABASE_URL` is wrong or needs URL-encoding |
| `database "scammap" does not exist` | step 3 of the quick start |
| `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432` | PostgreSQL is stopped (Windows: Services → postgresql-x64-17 → Start; macOS: `brew services start postgresql@16`) |
| every call returns 403 `LICENSE_EXPIRED` | no valid licence yet: run the `sign-licence ... --upload` command |
| 403 with `reason: CLOCK_ROLLBACK` | the computer's clock is behind a time the server already saw: fix the clock (`npm run clock` shows the stored time) |
| `EADDRINUSE :8080` | another server is running; close it or set `PORT=8081` in `.env` |
| `.env` change has no effect | restart the server: `.env` is read only at start-up |
| map is grey | the browser can't reach `tile.openstreetmap.org` (offline or blocked); the circles still work |
| "Gemini is not set up" | add `GEMINI_API_KEY` and restart; everything else works without it |
| Help → Safety checks says the local AI is off | start Ollama and `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`; on Windows keep `OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434` |
| Global threats switch says not connected | `npm run threats` tells you whether the URLhaus key works |
| an integration shows `off` or an error | `npm run integrations`, then see the table at the end of [Integrations setup](#integrations-setup) |

## Before you push to GitHub

- `keys/`, `*.pem`, `.env` and `data/creditcard.csv` are in `.gitignore`. Keep it that way.
- Commit `src/licence/publicKey.ts` (the public half); **never** the private key.
- Check before every push:

```bash
git status --ignored | grep keys/          # keys/ must be listed as ignored
git log -p | grep -c "PRIVATE KEY"         # must print 0
```

- If a private key was ever committed: `npm run gen-keys -- --force`, sign new licences, and rewrite the history (or
  start a fresh repository). Old licences stop verifying with the new key.

## Honest limitations

- Coordinated real people writing different text from different networks over days look like real victims. Rules C, D,
  I and J raise the cost; they can't make it impossible.
- Several real people on one carrier prefix reporting the same number within 24 h count as one (slower, never wrong-way).
- The grudge detector is a phrase list; a determined accuser can avoid the words. The 2-person ladder is the real defence.
- `ip_prefix` is trusted from the request body because the test tool sends it; set `TRUST_BODY_IP_PREFIX=false` in production.
- `/admin/reset` is unauthenticated because the brief requires it. Remove or protect it in production.
- OpenStreetMap's public tiles are for light use; set `VITE_TILE_URL` to a tile provider for real traffic.
- The imported datasets come from Bangladesh (messages) and Europe (cards). They improve and explain the answers, but
  Indian scams use other words: that's why the dataset model is weighted low and switched off when it doesn't recognise
  the text. Dataset labels can be noisy.
- The forecast is a short-term trend estimate from a few days of reports, not a prediction of individual scams.
